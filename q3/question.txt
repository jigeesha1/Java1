We have Employee class with properties, ID, NAME, ADDRESS

We need to sort them by their property.. 

Fill the code in Method m1()

m1(List<employee> l, String sortBy)
{

}

Depending on the String sortBy..(It can have value "ID"/"NAME"/"ADDRESS")
sort the list of employees... 

The coding should be generic, which can be used for any class... with any no of properties..

Hint: Use Comparator and Comparable
